# AI ASSISTANCE IN DATA MIGRATION DURING ERP IMPLEMENTATION PROJECTS

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

One of the common and tedious task during ERP implementation projects is to analyze the existing historical data and to prepare to migrate it to the new system.
Often such historical data structure is poorly documented, and the data itself may contain both valuable info and some noize. AI analysis could help map this data structure to the news system architecture and point out valuable insights about the quality and usability of historical data.

## Background

The proposed idea solves the problem of increased costs during the client's historical data analysis. Such a task often requires allocating a top-qualified specialist and it's often hard to predict the final man-hours required to do the analysis. AI could do at least some of the dirty work here.

The problem is often encountered in every ERP implementation project, so it's very common.

I'd like to research and evaluate possible solutions as a starting point for introducing AI technologies into my profession of managing ERP implementation projects.
I'd like to see the enthusiasm in the eyes of my team's leading developer when something like AI helps us to create value for the project the customer and the society.

## How is it used?

We provide AI with access to customer's historical data. Also, we provide some information on how this data is used by the customer and what are our goals of analysis - for example, to find problems with the data or to map the data to the new system's data structure.
AI provides us with insights about irregularities and possibly contradictory info it found, as well as recommendations on how to use the data for migration to the new system in the best possible way. The team then cross-checks the results and conducts the data migration with less risk and cost.

## Data sources and AI methods
The data comes from customer's existing IT systems and their databases.
We create a copy of it for evaluation and testing purposes and then connect our AI to that copy.
We then teach AI how to analyze a database structure and data contents.

## Challenges

Humans are still needed to create the necessary tools for AI to analyse a database, and to evaluate the outputs.
The problem of AI hallucinations could influence the project.
The data should be used only for analysis purposes and the customer's explicit consent for such use should be obtained.

## What next?

Let's get in touch and think it over in Zoom or Discord!
I'm just a project manager and consultant, so the insight of a developer would be very helpful.
